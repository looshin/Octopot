            <p id="word1">Octopotâ€™s overall mission is to provide equal access to clean hygiene for all. As an organization we divide ourselves into two segments: charity work, and business. For our charity work, we aim at create opportunities for all people to have access to hygiene. This can include products such as those under the pink tax(feminine hygiene products), to adult and infant incontinence products. Our volunteer section works at finding ways to increase the access of these products for marginalized communities.

            <p id="word2">If you see us at an event make sure to stop by and say hi. We will be hosting a variety of fundraisers, donations, and events to help gain resources for those in need. Additionally, a donation on the webpage can help just as much, even if you are buying merch for yourself. A percentage of all our proceeds go to helping those in need.
